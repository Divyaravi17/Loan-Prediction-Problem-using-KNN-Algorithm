### Techniques
1. Missing values
2. Outlier detection
3. Feature Engineering - Categorical Variables, Feature Selection (Select KBest, Chi square, ANOVA, Pearson Correlation, p-value)
4. Feature Scaling - Standard Scaler 

Also various Algorithms are applied with Hyper parameter tuning to choose the one which has best accuracy, to deploy it.
